<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet 
    language used for describing the presentation of a document 
    written in a markup language. Although most often used to set
    the visual style of web pages and user interfaces
    written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to
    any XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech,
    or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaSCript, CSS is cornerstone 
    technology used by most websites to create visually engaging
    webpages, user interfaces for web applications,
    and user interfaces for many mobile appllications.
