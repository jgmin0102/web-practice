<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
and interpreted programming language.
Alongside HTML, and CSS. JavaScript is one of the three
core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
IT is used to make webpages interactive and provide
online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it,
and all modern web browsers support it without the need
for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.
Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different
implementation of JavaScript, all based on the 
ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting
the specifully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond
ECMA.</P></div>
